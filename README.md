# toJulian-From-Gregorian
Julian Date to Gregorian

This little project deals with transfering dates from julian to gregorian and the opposite.
For now it only contains transfering from current date to the julian date. 

It returns the start and the end of the day as if the day starts at 5:00 and ends at 4:59 day after.
